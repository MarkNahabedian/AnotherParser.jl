TODO:

DerivationRule recognize method should note start index so it can pass
it and the end index as additional arguments to the constructor
function so that the entire matched input is available to the
constructor.  With this, we will no longer need StringCollector.

syntactic sugar for BNF by transforming Julia Exprs:

str macro for ref.  Need contect to get dictionary

::= for non-terminal definitions

&& and || for Sequence and Alternatives respectively.

What about Constructor?
Just use function call syntax?
