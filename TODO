TODO:

Maybe define a BNF for BNFs using our BNFNodes

syntactic sugar for BNF by transforming Julia Exprs:

str macro for ref.  Need contect to get dictionary

::= for non-terminal definitions

&& and || for Sequence and Alternatives respectively.

What about Constructor?
Just use function call syntax?
